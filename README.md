# What makes a pokemon special

Hi, this project is dedicated towards pokemon or more specifically, legendary and mythical pokemon. 

In this project, I have performed an in-depth analysis over various variables related to pokemon and tried finding their relations with respect to their status as a legendary or mythical pokemon.

I have also built a classification model to predict whether a pokemon is legendary, mythical or neither. The model uses random forest classification model to perform this multi-class classification.

The dataset for this project was taken from Kaggle and tweaked with a bit for it to be in the current state.
